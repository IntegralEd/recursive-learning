## Future Connectivity Architecture

### Event-Driven LMS Integration

The system is designed to evolve into a fully event-driven learning management architecture with the following capabilities:

1. **Dynamic Event Routing**
   - Event type detection and routing based on context
   - Fallback to user support when specific handlers unavailable
   - Organization-specific routing rules
   - Session-based event chaining

2. **xAPI Compatibility**
   - Event mapping to xAPI statements
   - Custom activity profiles
   - Extended context activities
   - Learning Record Store (LRS) integration ready

3. **Scenario Recipe System**
   - Dynamic workflow selection based on event context
   - Chainable learning activities
   - Conditional branching based on user progress
   - Organization-specific customizations

4. **Integration Points**
   - Webhook-driven architecture
   - Make.com scenario orchestration
   - Airtable as flexible data store
   - OpenAI for context-aware assistance

### Implementation Roadmap

1. Phase 1 (Current)
   - Basic chat support with comments
   - User-Organization validation
   - Simple event routing

2. Phase 2 (Next)
   - Extended event types
   - xAPI statement generation
   - Basic learning path tracking

3. Phase 3 (Future)
   - Full LMS integration
   - Advanced scenario recipes
   - Custom organization workflows
   - Analytics and reporting

4. Phase 4 (Vision)
   - AI-driven learning paths
   - Predictive next best action
   - Automated workflow optimization
   - Cross-organization insights

### Security Considerations

- Event routing uses non-encrypted keypairs for now
- Future: Add encryption layer for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting and validation
- Add organization-specific security policies

### Modular SAAS Architecture

The system is designed to be modular with:
- Pluggable event handlers
- Custom organization workflows
- Extensible activity profiles
- Flexible integration points

This architecture allows for:
- Easy addition of new event types
- Custom organization requirements
- Third-party integrations
- Scalable deployment options
